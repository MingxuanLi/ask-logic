This is usually because we also feel low in energy, can't be bothered or don't expect to get any enjoyment by doing these activities. It is easy to see why people can get stuck in a cycle of depression and find it difficult to get out.\n\nPsychologists and researchers have repeatedly found that pleasurable activities make a big difference in lifting mood.

Avoiding activity will leave you stuck in the blues and may increase depression.\n\n**But how do we get started?**\n\nThe best way is to collect ideas, make a plan, and stick with it."
